                        <p>Hi, I'm KhongMong, but you may also know me as Joshua.
                            <br>
                            I'm a part-time student at Saint Paul College, and am working towards a degree in Cyber
                            Security and
                            Computer Science.
                            <br>
                            My previous job as a product demonstrator has given me experience in a retail environment
                            where I am
                            frequently interacting with others of varying backgrounds, as I help them with any questions
                            they have, or
                            directing them to someone who can.
                            <br>
                            My previous job as quality assurance has given me experience on the technological side, as I
                            helped
                            university professors make sure their courses were displaying the correct information,
                            double checking their
                            courses, and fixing any issues in their courses. In that position, I worked closely and
                            collaboratively with
                            a group, and communicated effectively to accomplish these goals.
                            <br><br>
                            I currently work at a school, where I assist students with any technological issues they
                            have, whether it be
                            troubleshooting website access, or a hardware or software issue.
                            <br>
                            Personal experiences from both having a large family, and from having a family of non-native
                            speakers, have
                            helped me to learn how to communicate where it may be difficult, and to communicate to both
                            children, and
                            the elderly. These experiences, as well as my personal ambitions, also extend into helping,
                            caring, and
                            working with and for these groups, as well as others.
                            <br>
                            I believe that I have the necessary skills, knowledge, and the capacity to work alongside
                            others.
                            <br>
                            In my free time, I enjoy reading and playing games with friends and family.

                        <p>Aside from my personal interests of Cybersecurity and Comupter Programming, in my free time I
                            enjoy playing a variety of games such as League of Legends, Minecraft, and with the release
                            of Baldurs Gate 3, I found a particular interest in CRPGs/TTRPGs. Reading is another hobby
                            of mine, and I particularly enjoy fiction and fantasy, but I also enjoy reading YA novels.
                            When I had more free time, I used to spend multiple hours every day reading and managed a
                            book a day or every other day.</p>

                        My career goal is to become a programmer/developer, but am also holding in interest the prospects of being in the CyberSecurity field. If you have any career suggestions or think I would be interested in a position, please feel free to reach out using email.</p>
